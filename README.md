# ⚽ Reverse Akinator

A modern, highly-interactive web application built with React and Tailwind CSS. Instead of guessing the player you are thinking of, the AI attempts to guess by asking you up to 20 strategic questions!

## 🚀 Features
- **Strict State Management**: Robust state machine handling `INTRO`, `ASKING`, `LOADING`, `WIN`, and `LOSE` game flows.
- **Dynamic UI**: Beautiful, EA-Sports inspired cyberpunk aesthetic featuring glassmorphism and subtle micro-animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive component architecture that looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Vite & React**: Lightning-fast local development and optimized production builds.
